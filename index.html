                        <br/> <br/>    
                        I have two years of work experience in Technical Support work, while working at Mahatt Smoke co, I gained experience trouble shooting problems, performing remote solutions, increase productivity by creating small programs to assist in everyday tasks such as bill management, end of day reports, product information, as well as other small tasks. For the last three years I have also done some minor freelance work for small businesses and startup groups to try and keep myself occupied in my free time.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        As my time as a brand manager, I gained experience on how to work with people and find solutions towards growing issues at the time; During Covid-19 many setbacks were put on me due to growing issues regarding the virus. We managed to stay in business and come out more profitable than we were prior; although my position was a minor role the addition of branding, product screening, and properly maintaining the stores equipment, allowed some of the lesser robust locations to prosper and gain traction to form a steady growing business.
